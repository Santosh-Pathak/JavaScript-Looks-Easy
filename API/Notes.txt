API full form is an Application Programming Interface that is a collection
of communication protocols and subroutines used by various programs to
communicate between them. A programmer can make use of various API tools 
to make their program easier and simpler. Also, an API facilitates
programmers with an efficient way to develop their software programs. 
Thus api meaning is when an API helps two programs or applications to 
communicate with each other by providing them with the necessary tools 
and functions. It takes the request from the user and sends it to the 
service provider and then again sends the result generated from the service
provider to the desired user.
